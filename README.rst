What is this?
=============

This repository contains a collection of random algorithms that I keep writing/implementing
for day to day stuff. They may have no practical importance out there in the real world, but
at the time of writing them, I would have used to accomplish some small task or validate
results or so on. So just making a collection of them 

If you would like to build upon it or use it for some of your tasks feel free to **Fork**
the repostiory away.
